# Learning Perl 5.014

## Synopsis:

This is a folder that I created to store little tidbits of source code
and notes on scripting for Perl 5.014. The "foo" source file is the
reason why the LinuxUsersGroup_UWSP repository and this directory were
created in the first place.

- AskNameReturnName: I don't remember creating this source file, but it
appears to contain code for experimenting with the "say" feature (for printing
strings--appending with a newline character), the chomp feature (for removing)
any trailing newlines from STDIN, the <STDIN> (for reading from standard input)
and the "." string concatenation feature (forgive me for my seemingly useless
documentation; I am new to github so it gives me practice)

- BasicArithmetic: Eight lines of test code for experimenting with Perl's
binary (binary as in "bi-directional", not "bitwise") arithmetic operators
as well as an operator for the occurrences of strings.

- FirstPerlProgram: The first Perl program that I have ever written (as far
as I know anyway. But I've only been programming since August 2014 so it's
probably an accurate presumption.) I know it's not the proper "hello, world"
format but it's the thought that counts... And the fact that it runs.

- Foo: The whole reason this repository exists. Foo contains most of my notes
on lectures done by a founding member of the LUG@UWSP as well as the
occasional snippet of test code implementing things mentioned in the notes.
Our club president wished for me to upload this to my github, but I decided
to include the rest of my code (which, at the time of writing this README,
is probably slightly more than the length of a standard text message.) This
decision was simply to give this whole open-source thing a try for myself.
I don't know anything about properly releasing stuff under the GPL or what
IP infringements I may have caused by borrowing letters from the English
language, so please don't sue me.

- PerlHelloV2: Hopefully by the time you've seen this file, I have replaced
all profanity with wording to appeal to a more diverse audience (I'm sure
you can still figure out what the original program was if you really wish
to know.) This file contains test code for the two printing commands "print"
and "say".

- PerlHelloV3: The same as FirstPerlProgram, with the exception of an extra
comment.

- README.md: This README file.

- StartingOutWithVariables: Contains two variable declaration/initializations
and some test statements using them.

- StringConcat: Another version of the FirstPerlProgram "Hello World" program
using two concatenated strings instead of one.

- WelcomeProgram: The only program that was not written during a LUG meeting
(as of the date of the creation of this README.) This program welcomes the
user to Linux Club and asks them to enter their name. It then welcomes them
by the string they chose to input. This program was written in an attempt to
receive house points for my Hogwarts house that I will refer to here as
"Zogirclaw."

## Some final notes:

Although the initial reasoning behind pushing this repo to github was because
our club president requested that I add the foo source file, it was also a way
for me to get my feet wet with git and github. These source files were not
in any way originally intended for public posting or any practical use outside
of giving me practice using a revision control system. That being said, one
can expect to encounter code without comments, odd formatting, and general
uselessness within this directory. Enjoy!
